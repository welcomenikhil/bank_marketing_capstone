# Cost Reduction and Process Optimization in Retail Banking

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to build a predictive model for imbalanced data classification that identifies customers who have a higher probability of subscribing to a term deposit. 

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* RStudio

## Project Description
Banks are always trying to find ways to improve their revenue models based on customer needs and behaviour by personalizing their products and services to drive greater levels of customer satisfaction and retention. As a result, a bank is searching for creative solutions to address their revenue decline, which is linked to a decrease in the number of term deposit subscriptions. In this project a classification model will be developed that will help answer how many customers the bank labelled as non-subscribers for a term deposiy account actually subscribed to a term deposit, and of all the customers who are subscribers, how many of those did the bank correctly predict. For each of the supervvised machine learning techniques (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks) used to build this predictive model, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and specificity were the performance metrics analyzed. Functions in the caret package in RStudio were used to execute data cleaning, imputing, preprocessing, and model training, including cross-validation and testing. The dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and consists of 45,211 data points and 17 attributes.
